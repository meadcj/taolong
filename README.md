# Playing the Game

Click on a circle in the Board of Ba Gua to pick up stones from that location. The game will automatically count out the stones and make the appropriate move (if it is a valid play). If it is not a valid play, nothing will happen. After a valid move has been chosen, if additional choices are required (for moves with multiple valid options), cyan circles will be shown for each of the possible move choices.

For Fire and Water moves, the choice of absorbing or expelling the element is provided after the move phase. To absorb an element, click the circle at the center of the Board of Ba Gua. To expel an element, click the circle placed over the head of the dragon.

If no valid move is available, a message will appear (currently only in the developer's console). The current player must then select a circle from which to move stones, but no move will follow.

The current turn is indicated by the color-coded Yang or Yin symbol.
